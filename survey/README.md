## The deployerâ€™s problem: Configuring application servers for performance and reliability. (ICSE '03)
This paper is the first work that focus on this problem. It outlines the problems facing the deployer of applications, and presents a trivail methodology that can assist the programmer with the task of configuring application servers, and presents two case studies that validate the usefulness of the methodology. 
## Online response time optimization of apache web server. (IWQoS '03) 
This paper uses a fuzzy control based hill-climbing algorithm to online optimize response time of a web server.It's performance metrice is response time and tuning parameter is MaxClinet and uses static workload and dynamic workload to compare the result.
##A smart hill-climbing algorithm for application server configuration.(WWW '04)
This work is the improvement of the hill-climbing algorithm with importance sampling and Latin Hypercube Sampling. The performance is also the response time but the tuning parameter is increased to four parameters: The maximum number of threads in the Web Container thread pool, the maximum number of threads in the EJB Container thread pool, the maxi mum number of connections to the database in the Data Source Connection Pool, the maximum size of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on which WebSphere runs. And, this work mimics a production system for an on-line brokerage application.
